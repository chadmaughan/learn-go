The 'go' tool helps manage go source code

The help documentation is great

$ go help get
$ go get gotour

According to http://code.google.com/p/go-tour/ you must have mercurial installed to have 'go get'

$ go help build
$ go build

compiles imports and dependencies but doesn't install them

$ go help clean
$ go clean

gets rid of artifacts from manual builds

$ go help install
$ go install

like 'go build' but it also installs them

$ go help fmt
$ go fmt

formats your code (nice!)
it outputs the names of any files that it modifies

$ go help run
$ go run program.go

compiles and runs your code
